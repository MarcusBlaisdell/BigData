// Query to calculate the pagerank for each video and write back the results as a property of video (property named "pagerank")
// This query will return only the stats for this operation and result of the pagerank will be written in the property of a video
// We are writing the result back to the property because we don't know pagerank calculation is a highly computational algorithm 
// and the result is not going to change as our database has fixed number of videos.
// We will need to run this if we add more Videos or RELATED_TO relationships between videos
